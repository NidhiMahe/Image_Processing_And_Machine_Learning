Image processing enhances image quality, enables feature extraction, and allows for various manipulations. Basic image processing like color conversion, shape, drawing etc, can be efficiently handled using libraries like scikit-image.
For more advanced image processing tasks blending images, detecting faces etc, OpenCV provides powerful tools and functions. As the complexity increases, especially in tasks like face recognition, object detection, and segmentation, deep learning models and libraries become essential. FaceNet , deepface, facerecognization are prime example for face recognition, while TensorFlow and PyTorch are crucial for building and deploying custom deep learning models. By mastering these image processing techniques and the appropriate Python libraries, we can pave the way for more successful and efficient computer vision applications.
